Team Project with 4 team members making a 2D Classic Game:
During this project we made a 2D game in Unity using mechanics and game design inspired directly by the 2D Classic Game Gauntlet.
Contributions:
Noah Ferguson(Lead Programmer): Contributed majority of the code, designing the enemies and enemy spawners, player movement, and projectiles. Also designed the UI for the game as well as created several pickups such as a chest for a score system and a key to unlock doors.
